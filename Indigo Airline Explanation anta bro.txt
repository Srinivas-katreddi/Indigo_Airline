Problem Dispose:

one of the famous company Indigo airline facing the problem of customer experience (and build lasting loyality) to identify which passengers are most likely to recommend the airline to others.


solution:

1.Approach:
For solving this problem I was taking the dataset of passenger reviews from 2006 to 2019 the dataset consists of 

airline: Name of the airline.
overall: Overall points given to the trip between 1 and 10.
author: Author of the trip.
reviewdate: Date of the customer's review.
aircraft: Type of the aircraft.
travellertype: Type of traveler (e.g., business, leisure).
Flight date: Cabin at the flight date flown.
cabin service: Rated between 1-5.
foodbev: Rated between 1-5.
groundservice: Rated between 1-5.
valueformoney: Rated between 1-5.
recommended: Binary, target variable.

Solution:
I was used numpy, pandas libraires to clean the dataset. The dataset consists of apx.40,000 rows and 17 columns. And I was droped 20189 rows duplicated rows were droped, and I was fill the missing values with mean (with numertical values) and mode (with categorical values). The review date was exesited as object datatype and now I was changed it into Date and Time formate.
Using matplot and seaborn I was drawen different plots bar plot,scatter plot,pie chart,box plot..... From this plots I understand recommended "yes"[8839] and "no"[10971] by pie chart.


The airline column has very huge recommended on indigo airline.Overall,cabin,seat_comfort,value_for_money,Food_bev columns has negative impact on the Indigo airline.Airline,cabin services has the very high positive impace and sentimental score is positive
